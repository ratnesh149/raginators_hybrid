Step 1: Eliminate Resume Chunking
Why: Current chunking creates duplicate entries

Solution: Process whole resumes instead of chunks

Tools:

unstructured.io (replaces PyPDF2) for better PDF text extraction

resumeparse library for structured data extraction

Benefit: 100% elimination of duplicate candidates

Step 2: Implement Unique Candidate Identification
Why: Multiple candidates with same name cause file conflicts

Solution: Generate unique IDs based on file content

Tools:

hashlib.md5 for content-based hashing

Example ID: candidate_7d3f8a1b instead of Li_Wei

Benefit: Resolves PDF download errors

Step 3: Upgrade Vector Database
Why: ChromaDB lacks advanced deduplication features

Solution: Migrate to Weaviate or Qdrant

Key Features Needed:

Native grouping/deduplication

Numeric range filtering (experience years)

Array filtering (skills/domains)

Recommendation: Weaviate for its superior grouping capabilities

Benefit: Returns 5 unique candidates guaranteed

Step 4: Enhance Metadata Extraction
Why: Manual parsing fails with resume variations

Solution: Use AI for structured data extraction

Tools:

GPT-4 Turbo (or Llama 3) with function calling

Pydantic models for validation

Extract Fields:

python
name: str
experience: float  # in years
skills: list[str]
domains: list[str]
unique_id: str
Benefit: Accurate experience/skill filtering

Step 5: Implement Hybrid Search
Why: Pure vector search causes low diversity

Solution: Combine vector + keyword search

Implementation:

Vector: Semantic understanding of experience descriptions

Keyword: Precise skill/domain matching

Query Example:
"React experts (vector) + Python AND AWS (keyword) + experience ‚â•5 years (filter)"

Benefit: Higher quality candidate matches

üí∞ Resource Requirements
New Tools:

Weaviate (open-source)

unstructured.io (Apache 2.0 license)

GPT-4 API credits ($0.01/resume)

Effort:

3 developer-weeks

1 QA week

Manager oversight: 2hrs/week

Risks:

Learning curve for Weaviate

LLM extraction costs

Mitigation: Start with small batch testing
