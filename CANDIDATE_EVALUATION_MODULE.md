# Advanced Candidate Evaluation Module

## Overview

This module implements the requirements from `new 6.txt` - an advanced candidate evaluation system that is triggered after candidate shortlisting and job description finalization. It evaluates each shortlisted candidate against the job description with 90%+ accuracy threshold and provides detailed justification for selection/rejection decisions.

## Key Features

### ✅ **Requirements from new 6.txt - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

1. **Triggered after candidate shortlisting and job description finalization** ✓
2. **Evaluates each shortlisted candidate against job description** ✓
3. **Calculates match score using:**
   - Semantic similarity ✓
   - Skills alignment ✓
   - Experience mapping ✓
4. **Automatically selects candidates with 90% or higher accuracy** ✓
5. **Provides justification:**
   - For selected candidates: highlights key matching criteria (skills, experience, certifications) ✓
   - For rejected candidates: specifies gaps (missing skills, insufficient experience, role mismatch) ✓

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **`services/candidate_evaluator.py`** - Main evaluation engine
2. **`tools/candidate_evaluation.py`** - LangGraph tool integration
3. **Integration in `app.py`** - Streamlit UI integration

### Evaluation Criteria Extraction

The system automatically extracts evaluation criteria from job descriptions:

```python
@dataclass
class EvaluationCriteria:
    required_skills: List[str]
    preferred_skills: List[str]
    min_experience: int
    max_experience: int
    required_certifications: List[str]
    role_level: str  # junior, mid, senior, lead
    domain_keywords: List[str]
```

### Scoring Algorithm

**Weighted Scoring (Total = 100%)**:
- **Semantic Similarity**: 20% - Overall content match with job description
- **Skills Alignment**: 35% - Most critical for technical roles
- **Experience Mapping**: 25% - Role fit based on years of experience
- **Certification Score**: 10% - Professional certifications
- **Role Fit Score**: 10% - Level appropriateness (junior/mid/senior/lead)

### Selection Threshold

- **90% threshold** for automatic selection (as specified in requirements)
- Candidates scoring ≥90% are automatically selected
- Candidates scoring <90% are rejected with detailed gap analysis

## Usage

### 1. Programmatic Usage

```python
from tools.candidate_evaluation import candidate_evaluation_tool

# Get structured evaluation results
results = candidate_evaluation_tool.get_evaluation_summary(
    candidates=shortlisted_candidates,
    job_description=job_description_text
)

# Get formatted output for display
formatted_output = candidate_evaluation_tool._run(
    candidates=shortlisted_candidates,
    job_description=job_description_text,
    evaluation_mode="full"  # or "summary"
)
```

### 2. Streamlit Integration

The module is automatically triggered in the main application after candidate shortlisting:

1. User performs candidate search
2. Candidates are shortlisted using existing tools
3. **NEW**: Advanced evaluation is automatically triggered
4. Results show selected/rejected candidates with detailed justification
5. UI displays evaluation scores and reasoning

### 3. Evaluation Results Structure

```python
{
    'selected_candidates': [
        {
            'candidate': {...},  # Original candidate data
            'score': CandidateScore(...),  # Detailed scores
            'justification': {
                'decision': 'SELECTED',
                'selection_reasons': [...],
                'recommendation': '...',
                'detailed_scores': {...}
            }
        }
    ],
    'rejected_candidates': [...],  # Similar structure
    'summary': {
        'total_evaluated': int,
        'selected_count': int,
        'rejected_count': int,
        'selection_rate': str,
        'average_score': str,
        'evaluation_criteria': {...}
    }
}
```

## Evaluation Criteria Detection

### Skills Extraction
- **Required Skills**: Extracted from "Required Skills:" sections
- **Preferred Skills**: Extracted from "Preferred Skills:" or "Nice to have:" sections
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handles partial skill matches and variations

### Experience Requirements
- Detects patterns like "4-7 years", "5+ years", "minimum 3 years"
- Handles both closed ranges (4-7) and open ranges (5+)
- Maps candidate experience to requirements with scoring

### Role Level Detection
- **Junior**: entry, associate, junior, jr.
- **Mid**: developer, engineer, analyst, specialist
- **Senior**: senior, sr., lead, principal
- **Lead**: manager, director, head, team lead

### Certification Requirements
- Detects certification mentions in job descriptions
- Matches against candidate profiles
- Distinguishes between required and preferred certifications

## Justification System

### For Selected Candidates (≥90% score)
- **Key Strengths**: Highlights matching skills, experience, certifications
- **Recommendation**: "HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - Meets all key criteria"
- **Detailed Scores**: Breakdown of all evaluation dimensions

### For Rejected Candidates (<90% score)
- **Identified Gaps**: Specific missing skills, experience mismatches
- **Assessment**: Clear explanation of why candidate doesn't meet threshold
- **Score Breakdown**: Shows where candidate fell short

## Testing

Run the comprehensive tests to verify functionality:

```bash
# Basic functionality test
python3 test_new_evaluation_module.py

# High-scoring candidate test
python3 test_evaluation_with_selection.py

# Perfect candidate test
python3 test_perfect_candidate.py
```

## Configuration

### Adjusting Selection Threshold

If 90% proves too strict for your use case, you can adjust it:

```python
# In services/candidate_evaluator.py
class CandidateEvaluator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.selection_threshold = 0.85  # Change from 0.90 to 0.85 (85%)
```

### Adjusting Scoring Weights

Modify the weights in `evaluate_candidate()` method:

```python
weights = {
    'semantic': 0.15,    # Reduce semantic weight
    'skills': 0.40,      # Increase skills weight
    'experience': 0.25,  # Keep experience weight
    'certification': 0.10, # Keep certification weight
    'role_fit': 0.10     # Keep role fit weight
}
```

## Integration Points

### 1. Main Application (app.py)
- Lines 417-540: Automatic evaluation after shortlisting
- Lines 684-747: UI display of evaluation results
- Lines 780-781: Summary statistics

### 2. Candidate Display
- Evaluation status badges (SELECTED ⭐ / REJECTED)
- Detailed score breakdowns
- Expandable justification sections

### 3. Download System
