## How It Works

### 1. **Data Collection**
Every time you perform a candidate search, the system automatically records:
- Search criteria (job title, skills, experience, location, education)
- Number of results found
- Quality of matches (based on match scores)
- Success indicators (good matches vs total results)

### 2. **Pattern Recognition**
The system analyzes collected data to identify:
- **Job Title â†’ Skills Correlations**: Which skills are most successful for specific roles
- **Experience Level Effectiveness**: How well different experience filters perform
- **Location Preferences**: Most searched locations and their success rates
- **Education Correlations**: Education requirements that yield better results

### 3. **Intelligent Insights**
Based on learned patterns, the system provides:
- **Skill Recommendations**: Suggests relevant skills for job titles
- **Experience Insights**: Shows success rates for different experience levels
- **Field Effectiveness**: Indicates which search criteria work best
- **Popular Combinations**: Highlights successful search patterns

## Training Data Structure

### Search Interactions
