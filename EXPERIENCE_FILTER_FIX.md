# Experience Filtering Fix

## Problem Identified
When selecting "3-5 years" experience level, the system was returning candidates with 8, 16, and 21+ years of experience. This happened because the filtering logic only applied a **minimum** experience threshold, not a **maximum**.

## Root Cause
The original implementation only checked:
```python
if candidate_experience >= min_experience:
    # Include candidate
```

This meant:
- "3-5 years" → `min_experience = 3` → Included anyone with 3+ years
- "6-10 years" → `min_experience = 6` → Included anyone with 6+ years

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Input Schema
Added maximum experience parameter to the candidate shortlist tool:

```python
class CandidateShortlistInput(BaseModel):
    job_requirements: str = Field(description="Job requirements and skills to match against")
    min_experience: int = Field(default=0, description="Minimum years of experience required")
    max_experience: int = Field(default=999, description="Maximum years of experience required")  # NEW
    n_candidates: int = Field(default=10, description="Number of top candidates to return")
```

### 2. Updated Experience Range Logic
Changed from minimum-only to range-based filtering:

**Before:**
```python
# Extract experience requirement
min_exp = 0
if experience_level != "Any":
    if "3-5" in experience_level:
        min_exp = 3  # Only minimum, no maximum
```

**After:**
```python
# Extract experience requirement (both min and max)
min_exp = 0
max_exp = 999  # Default to no upper limit

if experience_level != "Any":
    if "0-2" in experience_level:
        min_exp, max_exp = 0, 2
    elif "3-5" in experience_level:
        min_exp, max_exp = 3, 5  # Both min AND max
    elif "6-10" in experience_level:
        min_exp, max_exp = 6, 10
    elif "10+" in experience_level:
        min_exp, max_exp = 10, 999
```

### 3. Updated Filtering Logic
Changed the candidate filtering to use range-based checking:

**Before:**
```python
if candidate_experience >= min_experience:
    filtered_candidates.append(result)
```

**After:**
```python
if min_experience <= candidate_experience <= max_experience:
    filtered_candidates.append(result)
```

### 4. Enhanced User Feedback
Added visual indicators to show the experience filter is active:

- Chat message includes experience range: "filtered for 3-5 years experience"
- Results section shows: "Experience Filter Applied: Only showing candidates with 3-5 years experience"

## Test Results

### Before Fix:
**Query: "Software Engineer with React, 3-5 years experience"**
- Nour Khalil: 21 years experience ❌
- Li Wei: 16 years experience ❌  
- Khalid Al-Mansouri: 8 years experience ❌

### After Fix:
**Query: "Software Engineer with React, 3-5 years experience"**
- Only candidates with 3-5 years experience are returned ✅

### Verification Tests:
- **0-2 years**: Returns candidates with 2.0 years ✅
- **3-5 years**: Returns candidates with 5.0 years ✅
- **6-10 years**: Returns candidates with 6, 8, 9, 10 years ✅

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Filtering**: Experience ranges are now strictly enforced
2. **Better Relevance**: Candidates match the actual experience requirements
3. **User Confidence**: Clear feedback shows filtering is working
4. **Flexible Ranges**: Supports all experience levels including open-ended (10+)

## Technical Details

### Experience Level Mappings:
- **Entry Level (0-2 years)** → 0-2 years
- **Mid Level (3-5 years)** → 3-5 years  
- **Senior Level (6-10 years)** → 6-10 years
- **Expert Level (10+ years)** → 10-999 years
- **Any** → 0-999 years (no filtering)

### Error Handling:
- If no candidates match the experience range, returns appropriate message
- Graceful handling of missing experience data (defaults to 0)
- Maintains all other filtering and deduplication logic

## Future Enhancements

1. **Flexible Ranges**: Allow custom experience ranges (e.g., "2-7 years")
2. **Experience Weighting**: Prefer candidates closer to the middle of the range
3. **Experience Context**: Consider industry-specific experience requirements
4. **Skill-Experience Correlation**: Weight experience differently based on required skills

*This fix ensures that experience filtering works as expected, providing users with candidates that truly match their specified experience requirements.*
